# Complete Example üöÄ

This directory contains a complete example demonstrating how to use the **Rds** Terraform module with all features enabled.

## üîß What's Included

### Analysis of Terraform Configuration

#### 1. Main Purpose
The main purpose of this Terraform configuration is to provision and manage multiple RDS (Relational Database Service) instances for different database engines (MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL) within an AWS environment. It demonstrates how to configure various RDS parameters, database management settings, and backup/restore mechanisms.

#### 2. Key Features Demonstrated
- **Multi-Database Engine Support**: Configuration for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases.
- **Parameter Customization**: Detailed customization of database parameters such as engine version, maintenance windows, backup settings, and connection limits.
- **Security Configuration**: Ingress rules and CIDR blocks to control access to the databases.
- **Backup and Restore**: Configuration for enabling database backups to S3 and setting up backup schedules.
- **Database Management**: Management of databases, users, and their respective privileges.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Enabled CloudWatch logs exports for monitoring and logging purposes.

#### 3. AWS Services Being Used
- **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**: For managing MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases.
- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: For storing database backup snapshots.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: For logging and monitoring database performance.
- **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: For managing permissions and access to resources.
- **AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: For network configuration, including subnets and security groups (implied by `subnet_ids`).

This configuration provides a comprehensive setup for deploying and managing multiple RDS instances with various advanced features and security settings.

## üöÄ Quick Start
